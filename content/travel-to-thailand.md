// TODO

## Chiang Mai

NOTE: [Chiang Mai looks quite dead as of April
2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDLM_XX-rY). Consider waiting a few more
months for tourism to pick back up.

### Getting there

Chiang Mai has an international airport. Scoot runs direct flights there.
Alternatively consider combining Bangkok and Chiang Mai in the same trip.

### Accommodation

I feel like the prices on booking.com are inflated. Probably can get cheaper
prices by booking in person.

- [Stamps](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/stamps-backpackers.en-gb.html). Book in advance.
- [The Common Hostel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/slow-poke-poshtel-by-bed.en-gb.html)

### Things to do

Some compilations: [twowanderingsoles.com](https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/unique-experiences-in-chiang-mai-thailand#Adventurous-Things-to-do-in-Chiang-Mai).

- [r/thailandtourism](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/) is an active community.
- Food tour by [A Chef's Tour](https://achefstour.com/tour/chiang-mai-food-tour) ([TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g293917-d12845334-Reviews-A_Chef_s_Tour_Chiang_Mai-Chiang_Mai.html)). Seems somewhat expensive, but well recommended. May be worth the money.
- [Doi Suthep Walkers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DoiSuthepWalkers/)
  Facebook group with organized hikes. Usually weekly on Saturday mornings.
  Range of difficulties.
- Monk's Trail (Wat Pha Lat Trail). About a 30 minute hike. Temple at the end
  of the trail.
- Live music at [Seven Pounds](https://goo.gl/maps/JGZ97jTCsCxx5ryYA)
- Chill at Stamps hostel at night even if you're not staying there.
- Markets:
    - Chiang Mai Gate Market
    - Saturday Night Market
    - Sunday Night Market
- Temples:
    - Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. One of the more (most?) iconic temples in
      Chiang Mai.
    - Wat Suan Dok. Show up in the evenings on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday to
      chat with a monk.
- Festivals:
    - [April] Songkran
    - [November] Loy Krathong

## Pai

### Getting there

Pai can be reached from Chiang Mai. Travel options ordered by speed are by
scooter or minibus. Booking a bus can be done at
[12go.asia](https://12go.asia). There may be other better booking options, but
I haven't researched this.

### Things to do

- Pai Canyon. Consider bringing proper hiking shoes; there's a path across a
  ridgeline that may be a little dangerous.
