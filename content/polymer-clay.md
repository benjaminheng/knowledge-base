## Baking

- Using a [Sona SMO 23A toaster oven](https://www.sona.com.sg/smo-23a-10l-mini-oven), 150C on the dial
  corresponds to 130C internal temperature.
- Do a few test runs with a baking thermometer to calibrate your oven; the
  temperature usually doesn't exactly match the value on the dial.
- [Glass Attic page on baking](https://www.glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm)
- Sculpey Premo baking instructions: 135 degrees C for 30 minutes per quarter
  inch of thickness.
- If not pre-heating, remember to add an additional 10 minutes or so to allow
  the oven to get up to temperature.
- Place the item on a piece of parchment paper to avoid shiny spots where the
  item touches the surface it is baking on.
- Cover the item with a tent of aluminum foil to keep the temperature
  consistent, since the oven will cycle the heating elements on an off.
