title: "Investment custodian accounts"
---

Some investment advisors, such as Endowus, will make it a point to mention that
your investments are held in a custodian account _in your name_. Other advisors
will leave out the part about the account being "in your name".

When an advisor uses a custodian account not in your name, your investments are
co-mingled with other investors in a single custodian account. The legal owner
of those investments is still the advisor. The bank has no record of which
investments you own; the advisor has the ledger with that knowledge.

To be fair, advisors with shared custodian accounts are still MAS-certified.
Your investments will not be compromised. There will however be more friction
to claim your investments if the company ceases operation. You may be required to
liquidate your investments, which given timing could be non-ideal.

Advisors with custodian accounts _in your name_ is preferable from a security
and risk-mitigation perspective. In the event that the advisor ceases
operation, you can go to the custodian bank and claim your investments from
them. Your investment ledger is owned by the bank, and kept seperate from the
advisor's ledger.
