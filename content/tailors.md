title: "Tailors"
---

I've had good experiences with [YinYin Fashion Alteration
Specialist](https://goo.gl/maps/5Di7ugBGnoP2xpgNA) in the past. They're located
at Tanjong Pagar. I had three pairs of pants altered there. Turnaround time is
quick and the quality of the alteration is good. Now that I no longer work at
Tanjong Pagar, it's a bit inconvenient to go down to tailor clothes.

I've also had a couple t-shirts tailored at [Xin En
Tailoring](https://goo.gl/maps/NhwDjwt1CYftKqnP9) in Tampines. It was just a
simple hem on both shirts, so I can't speak for their quality on more complex
tailoring jobs. The shirts turned out well though. A part of the stitching on
one shirt was a bit uneven, but they're just t-shirts, so it's not a big deal
at all. Turnaround time was a week.
