## DIY

The main problem with DIY is getting suspension base shipped to SG. Can't find any local sellers, and any international shipments will require additional feels for handling hazardous materials. [Glitter Unique](https://www.glitterunique.com/) ships for $50, but I suspect this is before the hazardous handling fee. Worth emailing to check.
