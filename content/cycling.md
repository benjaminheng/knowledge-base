## Maps

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - Select the CyclOSM or OpenCycleMap overlays.
- [Google Maps: Map of park connectors](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&dg=feature&mid=1wpVo946QUwM2HM4MvNmvr2UdYG0&ll=1.4152748545020726%2C103.8337928146973&z=13)
- [Google Maps: Better map of park connectors](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1d-f3wTmqM3jmT7C1LtTzorsRbGw&shorturl=1&ll=1.333225619549455%2C103.93625551620613&z=15) - PCNs, CPNs, MTB routes, common road links, annotations.

## Route planning

- [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org/) - My preferred map for looking at cycling routes.
- [BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/) - OSM-based. Very customizable. Intuitive route planning. My current go-to for route planning.
- [OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/) - Just an overlay over OSM; no routing capabilities. UI is fast. Information is clearly displayed. Mostly useful just for high level exploration.
- [OpenRouteService](https://maps.openrouteservice.org) - OSM-based. Uses the CyclOSM overlay. Less customizable compared to BRouter. Route suggestions are not as complete, because you can't customize your preference cycling paths. A few annoying UI quirks.
- [RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/new) - OSM-based. One of the better route planners. Requires an account to save and export, probable dealbreaker.

## Miscellaneous

- https://ridingtales.com - Travel reports on a Birdy, Reach, and other bikes.
- [How To Build Your Own Bike (And Why You Should Do It)](https://www.icebike.org/build-your-own-bike/)
- [Bike assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU2ES4dvWkc)
- [OMATA One cycling computer](https://omata.com/collections/all/products/omata-one-kph?variant=47672917909) - Analog cycling computer. Expensive but kinda cool.
