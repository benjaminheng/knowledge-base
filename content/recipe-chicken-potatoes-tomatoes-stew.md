## Notes

- Inspired by this [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/colombian-chicken-stew-with-potatoes-tomato-onion-recipe).
- Ingredient amounts are rough. Add more or less of each ingredient based
  on your preference.
- Frozen and canned goods can be replaced with fresh ones; I used
  frozen/canned because I'm optimizing for convenience
