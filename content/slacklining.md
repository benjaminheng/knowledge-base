## Slackline spots in Singapore

- East Coast Park: https://goo.gl/maps/4iZkasqLros7rSn67 (training shed, benches, palm trees, nice grass, next to footpath)
- Bedok Reservoir Park: https://goo.gl/maps/2VqKmArNKuuW1Syy6 (near Forest Adventure, relatively secluded, well shaded)

## On steel vs aluminum carabiners

- Steel has an finite fatigue limit, aluminum does not[^1]. Having a fatigue limit means that below a certain load threshold, an infinite number of loading cycles can be applied without causing fatigue failure.
- Steel has higher tensile strength[^2].
- Steel wears less than aluminum[^3].
- Steel is more resistant to non-straight-line loading[^4].
