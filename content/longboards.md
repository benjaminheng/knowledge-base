## Bracket setup

Tentative setup:

- Deck: Bandito
- Front bracket: Gbomb glass drop
- Front truck: DT poppy 55. 125mm or wider?
- Rear bracket: Gbomb glass drop
- Rear truck: Randal 35deg or DT poppy rear 20

A 35deg truck in the rear with the glass drop (+/-15deg wedge) allows us to bring our rear angle to 20deg. With a 40deg truck, we'd only get down to 25deg. Alternatively, a DT rear poppy is available with a 20deg angle, but this truck is much more expensive.

Alternative components:

- [Lepsk8 integrated front truck](https://www.lepsk8.com/product/ldp-integrated-rkp-front-truck-55-degree/) -- [RKP may have wheelbite on the bandito.](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboardingDISTANCE/comments/1akt015/board_recommendations_please_pantheon_bandito_vs/kpp1iaa/) TKP version might work better. Pantheon is running a limited run of Bandito completes with a custom made Lepsk8 TKP front truck. Look out for that.
