title: Titanfall 2
---
One of the best single-player campaigns I've played in a while. Finished it in
around 4 hours, so it's relatively short as far as single-player campaigns go.
However this is largely because the game has very little to no filler, and I
love it for that. Too many games try to drag out content to hit some arbitrary
industry benchmark of 10 hours or so of gameplay. Titanfall 2 instead has no
filler; it introduces a gameplay concept, explores it, then moves on.

I tend to enjoy movement shooters. My most played game of all time is Team
Fortress 2 after all. Titanfall 2 absolutely does not disappoint in that
regard. There's an incredible amount of mobility in the game. Combined with
good gunplay and it makes for a very fast-paced and responsive game.
