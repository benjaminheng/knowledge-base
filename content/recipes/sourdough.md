## Maintaining starter

Once a week, discard all but 25g of starter. Add 100g of room temperature tap
water and stir until evenly dispersed. Add 100g of white bread flour and and
stir until a smooth paste. Return starter to the refrigerator. Feed once a
week.

## Tips

- Refresh an old loaf by brushing water and toasting in an oven for a few minutes. Can only do once.
