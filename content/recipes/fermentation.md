## Hot sauce

### 1 -- Jalapeno, ghost pepper

- 6 jalapeno peppers (150g)
- 0.5 ghost pepper
- 10 garlic cloves (30g)
- 1/2 yellow onion (70g)
- 3.5% brine

Additional notes:

- Bring pH down to < 4.5 using vinegar or lime juice to stabilize it before storing. Botulism threshold is 4.6? Aim for 3.5?
- Add fruits at the end

Log:
- 24h: Only a few bubbles. Minimal sign of fermentation. Consider lowering the brine percentage for the next batch.
- 48h: More bubbles! Solution starting to get cloudy. No mold yet. Looking good so far.
- Day 5: Fementation going well. No mold. I"m not using any weights so the peppers are floating to the top.

### 2 -- Habanero

- 100g habanero peppers (10pc)
- 38g garlic
- 70g onion
- 3.5% brine based on total weight

Log:
- 24h: Bubbles appearing. Starting to get cloudy. Fermentation started earlier than the previous batch.
