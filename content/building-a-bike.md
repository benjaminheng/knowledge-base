I'm currently in the process of building a bike. This page will contain my
research notes. It is going to be very unstructured.

## Research

### Frame

- Surly Cross-Check 52cm

### Brakes

- [Mini V-Brakes vs. Cantilever Brakes â€“ Advantages and Disadvantages Compared](https://brainybiker.com/mini-v-brakes-vs-cantilever-brakes-advantages-and-disadvantages-compared/)
- Probably will get mini-v or v brakes. Stronger and easier to set up and maintain.
- Leaning towards mini-v, but need to do more research.
- Mini-v will require a short-pull brake lever.
- 2022-08-29 update: Will be going with Shimano Deore T610 due to
  unavailability of the Tektro 726AL and other mini-v options.

Brakes:

- (Canti) Avid Shorty Ultimate. Expensive, but possibly worth it? Since I'm not
  intending to go for disc brakes, might be worth spending more on quality rim
  brakes.
- (V) Shimano Deore BR-T610 V-Brake. [bike-components](https://www.bike-components.de/en/Shimano/Deore-BR-T610-V-Brake-Set-p83063/), [universalcycles](https://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=110275).
- (Mini-V) Tektro RX6 https://www.tektro.com/products.php?p=49
- (Mini-V) TRP CX8.4 https://global.bluelug.com/trp-cx8-4-mini-v-brake-black.html

Brake pads:

-  Kool stop salmon supra 2 -- general purpose
-  Kool stop salmon type 2 -- for shimano brakes

Brake levers:

- Shimano Deore T610/T611
- [Dia Compe mx-2 polished silver](https://global.bluelug.com/ritchey-classic-flat-10-bar-silver.html) -- I think it'll go well with the silver handlebar, seen [here](https://global.bluelug.com/ritchey-classic-flat-10-bar-silver.html).
- [Velo Orange cru brake lever silver](https://global.bluelug.com/v-o-cru-brake-lever-silver.html)

### Cranks

- [Blue Lug RMC Multi Speed; Black; 165mm; 130 BCD](https://global.bluelug.com/blue-lug-rmc-multi-speed-crank-all-blk.html) (Crank-BB interface: square taper)
- SRAM Rival 1 (1x11) (Crank-BB interface: GXP, 24/22mm axle)

I really like the aesthetics of White Industries, but they're too expensive to
be part of my initial build. Maybe as a future upgrade.
[Inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/v813eg/new_crank_day/).

- Cranks https://www.whiteind.com/product/square-taper-eno-cranks/
- Chainring https://www.whiteind.com/product/square-taper-eno-1x-tsr-chainrings/

Square taper cranks tend to be thinner, because the crank-BB interface is
thinner. A hollowtech II interface is wider, and therefore the crank has to
have more material surrounding the interface. I'm leanings towards a square
taper BB, since I prefer the aesthetics of thinner cranks.

### Bottom brackets

- [Sugino Cartridge bottom bracket](https://global.bluelug.com/catalog/product/view/id/22103/s/sugino-cartridge-bottom-bracket/category/77/)
- Shimano BB-UN300 (Square taper)
- SRAM GXP A1 https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/bb-gxp-a1

### Freehub

Shimano hubs are generally regarded as somewhat silent hubs compared to other
brands. For a truely silent hub, consider Onyx hubs.

- Shimano Deore T610 (8/9/10/11 speed)
- Shimano 105 FH-R7000
  [store](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/shimano105-r7000/FH-R7000.html),
  [sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZGvVKlFOoU) -- Seems reasonably, not too obnoxiously loud
- Onyx hubs are silent. Do they still make rim brake compatible hubs with
  10x130mm/135mm spacing? Might need to email them to find out. Looks like the
  only product that matches those specs has been discontinued.

### Groupsets

- Shimano Deore M8000 (11 speed)
- Shimano SLX M7000 (11 speed)
- Shimano Deore XT (11 speed)
- Shimano Deore M5100 (11 speed)
- [Microshift Advent](https://www.microshift.com/products/groups/advent/) (9 speed)

### Cassette

I don't think I need a 11 speed for riding in mostly flat Singapore terrain. I
usually ride with 63 gear inches. A 10 speed 11-36 with a 42T chainring
provides provides similar gearing around that range. A 11 speed 11-42 is the
same as a 10-speed 11-36, but with one additional low gear.

- 11 speed 11-42: Shimano XT Cassette CS-M8000 11-speed
- 10 speed 11-36

### Wheelsets

[General consensus is that running a 35mm or higher tire on a rim with 17mm
inside width is
fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/5zfg48/my_rims_are_17mm_inside_width_can_i_really_get/).
In that case I'm leaning towards the Shimano 105 WH-RS300-CL. It's relatively
cheap, and with a fairly quiet hub. I'd like to upgrade to an Onyx hub in the
future, but I'll defer that upgrade for now.

- [Shimano 105 WH-RS300-CL](https://www.hupleong.co/shop-shimano/shimano-105-clincher-24-mm-wheelset)
- [Hunt 4season aero road](https://www.huntbikewheels.cc/products/hunt-4season-aero-road-wheelset-1589g-28deep-22wide) (freehub sounds quite loud though)

- [Fulcrum Racing 5](https://www.bike24.com/p2291009.html)

### Chainring

The chainring's BCD should match that of your cranks.

- Wolf Tooth https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainrings/chain-compatibility_all-9-10-11spd
- 130 BCD Wolf Tooth: https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainrings/products/130-bcd-cyclocross-chainrings?variant=14782015209507

### Handlebars + stem

- Consider getting a cheap adjustable stem to start with, to dial in the angle
  that feels most comfortable. As for length I'm leaning towards a shorter 60mm
  stem, considering that the CrossCheck frame has a relatively long reach by
  itself.
- Colors: Polished silver stem. Polished silver handlebars. Black grips (or brown?).
- If getting a steel stem, aluminum spacers will tend to be thicker and thus bulge out. Get steel spacers instead, such as [these from simworks](https://analogcycles.com/products/simworks-headset-spacers?variant=40095935135921)

Handlebars:

- [Velo Orange postino bar](https://velo-orange.com/products/vo-postino-handlebar-22-2mm) -- 570mm wide
- [Ritchey classic flat 10 bar](https://global.bluelug.com/ritchey-classic-flat-10-bar-silver.html) -- Simple and cheap
- [Velo Orange curvy bar](https://global.bluelug.com/velo-orange-curvy-too-handlebar-silver.html) -- 680mm wide. Wider version of the Postino bar.
- Jones H-Bar
- Surly Moloko handlebar -- a bit of a weird design, probably overkill in terms of hand positions
- [Fairweather b903 bullmoose
  bar](https://shop.circles-jp.com/en/products/fairweather-b903-bull-moose-bar)
  -- 710mm. Too wide, needs to be cut down significantly, but then it'll lose
  its charm. Not a good option for me, though I like the look.

Grips:

- Bar tape. I'll probably eventually go with this, out of desire to avoid logos
  or branding. Consider this combination of [cloth tape, twine, and
  shellac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhGAfWhaf4M).

Spacers:

- [Simworks cromoly steel spacers](https://shop.circles-jp.com/en/products/simworks-with-me-crom-spacer?variant=49598701524)

Stem cap:

- https://www.cycleprojectstore.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=headset-top-cap

### Tires

- Rene Herse: https://www.renehersecycles.com/product-category/components/tires/700c/
- Schwalbe
- Panaracer
- Gatorskins

### Headset

- [Fairweather matte silver](https://global.bluelug.com/fairweather-headset-1-1-8-matt-silver.html) -- Very clean design, minimal branding.
- [Ritchey classic gloss silver](https://www.bike24.com/p2295706.html)
- [Ritchey WCS logic black](https://www.bike24.com/p2647.html)
- Cane Creek 40
- [Velo Orange glossy
  silver](https://global.bluelug.com/velo-orange-grand-cru-headset-1-1-8-silver.html)
  -- Only silver works; the branding on the black is too visible.

### Pedals

- [MKS Allways](https://shop.circles-jp.com/en/products/mks-allways)

### Misc

- Star nut
- Steerer tube end cap

## Tools to buy

- Torque wrench: https://dcbikes.com.sg/products/bike-hand-1-4-mtb-road-2nm-24nm-pro-torque-wrench-set-tools
- Bottom bracket tool
- Grease
- Pipe cutter
- Star nut setting tool
- See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/uzh01n/was_lucky_enough_to_find_a_crosscheck_in_my_size/iab6lrj/) for more

## Random questions

- What's the difference between short/medium/long cage derailleurs? When would
  you use each?
- What gear ratios do I want or need? Need to decide this before we choose the
  cassette and front chainring size. Use sheldon brown's calculator.

## Random notes

- Consider Shimano Deore for the cassette and possibly other components as
  well. Seems to be generally regarded and having good quality for the price.
- For cranksets, aesthetics is one of my main factor. I'm not a fan of how
  Shimano cranksets look. I might use a SRAM crankset instead while using
  Shimano for the cassette.
- TODO: look into price difference between 10 speed and 11 speed groupsets. 11
  speed is definitely overkill for SG, but if it's not too much more expensive
  I might go for that. Otherwise I'll stick to 10 speed.
- Not sure if I should be concerned about toe overlap. Seems to be a common
  complaint about the Surly CC/Straggler.
