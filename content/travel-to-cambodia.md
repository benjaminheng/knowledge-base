## Siem Reap

Siem Reap is a short flight from Bangkok; consider adding Siem Reap on as a 2
or 3 day side trip if you're in Bangkok. Siem Reap doesn't have good flight
connectivity to other parts of Thailand though, so you'll need to layover in
Bangkok.

As of June 2022, the land border between Thailand and Cambodia is not open to
foreigners. Travel by air is necessary.

### Things to do

- Angkor Wat
- Phare Circus

### Cycling around Angkor

Cycling around Angkor is feasible. Bike rentals can go as low as $1/day.

There are two circuits that take you around Angkor's temples, a small and big
one. [Here's some information about the temples along each circuit, as well as a
map of the circuit
itself.](https://helloangkor.com/navigating-angkors-temples-the-small-circuit-the-grand-circuit-map-guide/)
