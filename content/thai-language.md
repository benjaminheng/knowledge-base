## Pronunciation

- K is pronounced softly, more like a G.
- Kh is pronounced as a hard K.

## Basic

For politeness, *krub* (as male) or *ka* (as female) can be appended.

- **Hello**: *sa-wat-dee krub*.
    - Append *krub* (as male), or *ka* (as female). The appended terms are
      used for formality or politeness, often when greeting strangers.
      *sa-wat-dee* may be casually spoken as *sa-wa-dee* instead.
- **Thank you**: *khawp khun*.
- **Yes**: *chai* or simply *krub*/*ka*
- **No**: *mai chai*

## Food

- **Chicken**: *gai*
- **Beef**: *nuua wuua* (meat of cow)
- **Pork**: *nuua muu* (meat of pig)

Notes:

- *nuua* means meat, so different types of meat can be referred to as "meat of
  \<animal\>". For example, beef is *nuua wuua*, which means "meat of cow".
  Simply saying *wuua* (cow) sounds strange; in English it would be like saying
  you want to eat a cow. However notice that chicken can be referred to as
  simply *gai* instead of *nuua gai*, because chicken is both a term for the
  meat and the animal.
