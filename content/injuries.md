## Finger injuries

What I've found works for me:

1. Finger glides ([example 1](https://orthonc.com/uploads/pdf/Tendon_Gliding_Exercises_Hand.pdf),
   [example 2](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/stories/experience-story-esther-smith-nagging-finger-injuries/))
2. Very light loading. A quick hack is to stand on a weighing scale while
   pulling on a hangboard. Pull just a few kg with a variety of hand positions.
