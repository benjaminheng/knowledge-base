This page contains my various contingency plans when travelling abroad. It's
intended to act as a sort of runbook. The plans are tweaked based on my threat
model for different destinations.

## General tips

- Bring backups where possible. Phones, credit cards, etc.
- Don't store the backup in the same place as the primary. Keep one card in
  your room, and one on your person.
- Store critical belongings on your person, not in a bag.
- Don't store critical belongings in the same place on your person. For
  example, don't use a phone case with a card holder; store both separately, in
  separate pockets.
- Depending on the threat model, consider more secure storage methods on your
  person. Zippered pockets, hidden clothing compartments, or pouches worn under
  your clothes.

## Preparing for the trip

Store the following on your phone. Store it on paper, in phone storage, in email, and in a cloud service.

- Flight tickets, or other transport tickets
- Insurance details
- Photo of passport
- Vaccination certificate, if applicable
- Address of your local embassy
- Passport-sized photos (in the event of a lost passport)

## Lost phone

Keep a backup phone in hotel room. Prepare it in advance so you can easily
access your documents.

1. Download your password manager file. Obfuscate the file name.
2. Download your password manager.
3. Download your backup Google 2FA codes. You won't have your 2FA
   device if your primary phone gets stolen. Store them in your password
   manager.

Make sure to do a dry run for your lost phone contingency. You'll probably need
to sign in once in order to download the password manager app from the app
store. Make sure to sign out after to avoid leaving an active account on the
phone if the backup gets stolen instead.

## Lost passport

Contact your embassy. Depending on the country you are in, a police report may
need to be filed first.

Losing a passport may not be a big deal if you're in a city where you have
physical embassy presence. Just visit the embassy and they'll help you out.
This also means that if travelling somewhere without embassy presence, you'll
want to take even better care of your passport.

## Lost credit card

Bring multiple cards. Keep a backup credit card in hotel room. Use your phone
to cancel the stolen card.

## Lost ID card

Contact your embassy. This is generally not a big deal. Some people prefer not
bringing their ID card along, but I prefer to. Having multiple forms of
identification, stored in separate locations is a good contingency to have in
the event that your passport or phone gets stolen.
