## Accessing the eshop in SG

SG doesn't have an associated eShop, so you have to register your account under a country that does, such as the US. If using the US eShop, you will be prompted for a zip code; be sure to select a state that doesn't have sales tax. I use the zipcode from my ComGateway address: 97220 in Portland, OR.

## Buying games

Switch games are really expensive compared to other platforms, and PC in particular. Here are some tips to optimize your spending:

- **Buy eShop credits locally.** For example: [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/Nintendo-eShop-Credit-USD50-(10-CASHBACK)-i.54257623.873626277) (roughly 10% off)
- **Switch your eShop region to buy games in cheaper regions.** Compare prices between regions with sites like [savecoins.app](https://savecoins.app/), [eshop-prices.com](https://eshop-prices.com/prices?currency=SGD). Switch games have no region-lock; any game registered to your account will work regardless of which region it was purchased in. Some regions may not accept your country's credit card, so your mileage may vary with this method.
- **Set up price alerts** on [DekuDeals](https://www.dekudeals.com) to notify you about deals on games you're interested in.

Some eShops allow the use of Paypal, but the option may only be available on the Switch eShop interface and not on the website. I've found this to be the case with the US eShop. To use Paypal for your purchases, first go to your Nintendo account settings on the website and link your Paypal account to it. Next make your purchase on your Switch instead.
