## Accessing the eshop in SG

SG doesn't have an associated eShop, so you have to register your account under a country that does, such as the US. If using the US eShop, you will be prompted for a zip code; be sure to select a state that doesn't have sales tax. I use the zipcode from my ComGateway address: 97220 in Portland, OR.

## Buying games

Switch games are really expensive compared to other platforms, and PC in particular. There are a few ways to optimize your spending:

- Buy eShop credits locally. For example: [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/Nintendo-eShop-Credit-USD50-(10-CASHBACK)-i.54257623.873626277) (roughly 10% off)
- Switch your eShop region to buy games in cheaper regions. Compare prices between regions with sites like [savecoins.app](https://savecoins.app/), [eshop-prices.com](https://eshop-prices.com/prices?currency=SGD). Switch games have no region-lock; any game registered to your account will work regardless of which region it was purchased in. Some regions may not accept your country's credit card, so your mileage may vary with this method.
- Set up price alerts on [DekuDeals](https://www.dekudeals.com) to notify you about deals on games you're interested in.
