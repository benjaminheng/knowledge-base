Infodump on Riichi Mahjong strategy as I learn.

- [Riichi Book One](https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks/), a strategy guide by Daina Chiba.
- Calling for yakuhai is often not worth it. A very common beginner (and even intermediate) mistake is to overvalue yakuhai. Many hands actually decrease in expected value if you call a yakuhai (since it is an exchange of one han for all of the potential han from a closed hand plus tanyao).[^1]
