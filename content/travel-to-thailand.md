## Covid travel restrictions

Information here is up to date as of 2022-06-14.

- A [Thailand Pass](https://www.thaiembassy.com/travel-to-thailand/thailand-pass) is
  required for each entry into Thailand. If you leave Thailand and wish to
  return, even just a couple days later, you'll need a new
  Thailand pass application.
- Each Thailand Pass application requires your inbound flight information. This
  means that last-minute trips into Thailand is infeasible. Flights will have
  to be booked in advance.
- The Thailand Pass is valid up to +3 days from the original date of arrival.
  This is to account for flight delays.
- Pass application typically takes 15min to 2 hours. It can take up to 12
  hours. It'll rarely take more than that.
- Pass application requires an address in Thailand. Accommodation may need to
  be booked before applying.

## Chiang Mai

### Accommodation

[Stamps](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/stamps-backpackers.en-gb.html) is one
of the more popular hostels in Chiang Mai. It's a social hostel, with events
being hosted each day. Their events are available to everyone; not just those
staying at the hostel. Even if not staying at Stamps, it's a good idea to stay
nearby and to hang out at Stamps occasionally.

### Things to do

Some compilations: [twowanderingsoles.com](https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/unique-experiences-in-chiang-mai-thailand#Adventurous-Things-to-do-in-Chiang-Mai).

- [r/thailandtourism](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/) is an active community.
- Food tour by [A Chef's Tour](https://achefstour.com/tour/chiang-mai-food-tour) ([TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g293917-d12845334-Reviews-A_Chef_s_Tour_Chiang_Mai-Chiang_Mai.html)). Seems somewhat expensive, but well recommended. May be worth the money.
- [Doi Suthep Walkers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DoiSuthepWalkers/)
  Facebook group with organized hikes. Usually weekly on Saturday mornings.
  Range of difficulties.
- [Monk's Trail](https://www.tielandtothailand.com/hiking-monk-trail-doi-suthep-chiang-mai/).
    - Two temples along the hike. About a 30 minute hike to Wat Phra That, and
      2 hours to Doi Suthep.
    - Go in early morning to avoid the mid-day heat.
- Live music at [Seven Pounds](https://goo.gl/maps/JGZ97jTCsCxx5ryYA)
- Chill at Stamps hostel at night even if you're not staying there.
- Markets:
    - Chiang Mai Gate Market
    - Saturday Night Market
    - Sunday Night Market
- Temples:
    - Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. One of the more (most?) iconic temples in
      Chiang Mai.
    - Wat Suan Dok. Show up in the evenings on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday to
      chat with a monk.
- Festivals:
    - [April] Songkran
    - [November] Loy Krathong
- Visit an Elephant sanctuary, maybe. Be aware of exploitation, even at
  "ethical" sanctuaries. [A truly ethical elephant sanctuary may not
  exist.](https://medium.com/@aydinadnan/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-elephant-sanctuaries-in-thailand-af3e4c9cb886)

## Pai

Seems to me like Pai is heavily geared towards tourists looking party. Might be
worth a trip if you intend to ride a scooter, since you'll then be able to
easily access the surrounding areas. Without a scooter you'd be mostly limited
to the town.

Pai can be reached from Chiang Mai. Travel options ordered by speed are by
scooter or minibus. Booking a bus can be done at
[12go.asia](https://12go.asia). There may be other better booking options, but
I haven't researched this.
