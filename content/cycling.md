## Route planning

*[OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/)*. Just an overlay over OSM; no routing capabilities. UI is fast. Information is clearly displayed. Mostly useful just for high level exploration.

*[BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/)*. OSM-based. Very customizable. Intuitive route planning.

*[OpenRouteService](https://maps.openrouteservice.org)*. OSM-based. Uses the CyclOSM overlay. Less customizable compared to BRouter. Route suggestions are not as complete, because you can't customize your preference cycling paths. However if you have a specific route in mind and don't need suggestions, the route planning using ORS is quite good.
