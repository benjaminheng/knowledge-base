Some of my favorite hot sauces:

1. [Scotch Bonnet & Ginger](https://queenmajestyhotsauce.com/products/queen-majesty-scotch-bonnet-ginger-hot-sauce-5oz)
   -- This is a hot one, but feels light on the palate because of how fruity it
   is. I typically use this for cooking. A drop or two goes a long way.
2. [Secret Aardvark Habanero](https://secretaardvark.com/shop/sauce/aardvark-habanero-hot-sauce/) -- Fairly mild, but a very, very versatile hot sauce. Can be added to pretty much anything. I used to keep a bottle of this in the office fridge.

The more artisanal brands of hot sauce aren't readily available in Singapore.
Shipping from the US ends up being pretty expensive as well. I've bought from
[Heat Hot Sauce](https://heathotsauce.com/) in the past, but there may be
stores with cheaper shipping to Singapore now.
