## B&W film developers

- In general: Ilford DD-X or Kodal Xtol.
- Ilford DD-X is expensive. It is also not reusable. Recommended dilution is
  1:4. Reports suggest that dilution does not have a noticeable impact. 1:7 to
  1:9 works as well, though development times have to be adjusted.
- D-76 is toxic. Xtol is not as toxic as it. Also D-76 comes in a fine powder,
  so care has to be taken when mixing. Generally Xtol is safer. If considering
  between Xtol and D-76, go with Xtol.
