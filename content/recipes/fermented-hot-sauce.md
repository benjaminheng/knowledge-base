title: Fermented hot sauce
---

## Batch 1 -- Jalapeno, ghost pepper

- 6 jalapeno peppers (150g)
- 0.5 ghost pepper
- 10 garlic cloves (30g)
- 1/2 yellow onion (70g)
- 3.5% brine

Log:
- 24h: Only a few bubbles. Minimal sign of fermentation. Consider lowering the brine percentage for the next batch.
- 48h: More bubbles! Solution starting to get cloudy. No mold yet. Looking good so far.
- Day 5: Fementation going well. No mold. I"m not using any weights so the peppers are floating to the top.
- Day 15: Still going well. No mold. Using a fermentation weight for the past few days.
- Day 21: Bottled.

Bottling notes:
- Added 50g of pineapple, some lemon zest, white vinegar, black pepper, and salt.
- Taste lacks depth. Quite spicy, but not much of other flavors. Consistency is a bit thick.
- pH brought down to 3.6 using white vinegar.
- Takeaways:
    - Blend with more of the fermentation liquid.
    - Pineapple alone isn't enough.
    - Consider fermenting with bell peppers.
    - Other spices are needed.

## Batch 2 -- Habanero

- 100g habanero peppers (10pc)
- 38g garlic
- 70g onion
- 3.5% brine based on total weight

Log:
- 24h: Bubbles appearing. Starting to get cloudy. Fermentation started earlier than the previous batch.
- Day 14: Bottled

Added half a small peach, lemon juice, white vinegar, black pepper, and some salt. pH brought down to 3.1.

Accidentally added too much vinegar. The pH value was 3.6 even before the vinegar, though I'm not confident that my pH meter isn't broken. Using pH strips indicate the pH should be around 4.0 instead, but it also doesn't seem very accurate.

I like the taste more than batch #1. The sweetness of the peach comes through and there's more depth of flavor. The taste is slightly too dominated by the vinegar though. Will add less next time.

Two weeks for fermentation is just right. I think with the hot weather here, going for three weeks is a little too long.

## Batch 3 -- Habanero (not started)

The main goal for this ferment is to experiment with adding more depth of flavor. I plan to attempt this through two aspects:

1. Use different types of peppers
2. Add roasted bell peppers for a more smoky flavor

Additionally, I'd like to try straining the sauce to achieve a smoother texture. Might use the immersion blender instead of the food processor as well, not sure if this will yield a finer blend.

I'm also going to try fermenting the fruits instead of adding it fresh at the end. Overall it's quite a lot of changes from the previous batch, so it's not exactly a scientific method, but I'm going ahead anyway.

Ferment:
- Length: 2 weeks
- 4 parts habanero peppers (10pc)
- 1 part ghost pepper
- Garlic
- Onion
- Roasted red bell peppers
- Cumin
- Allspice
- 3.5% brine based on total weight

Finish with:
- Apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar?
