I recently bought a tablet so I can play games while lying lazily on my bed.
I'm using Steam Link to stream games from my PC to the tablet. I'll jot down
some notes about my experiences so far.

[Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/) allows
games to be streamed from a PC to another device on the same network. It's
simple to set up and works really well. Steam Link supports a variety of inputs:

1. Touch
2. On-screen controller buttons
3. An external controller connected to the _guest_ device
4. An external controller connected to the _host_ device

Depending on the game I either use touch controls or the on-screen controller
buttons. I'm waiting for a tablet mount to be delivered, at which point I'll
likely switch to using my controller connected to the PC (host device).

Input lag may be noticeable depending on the game. I estimate it to be about
30ms. Fast-paced games like first-person shooters are not ideal, though
doable. Frame accurate games like Tetris or fighting games are out of the
question. However there are lots of games that are perfectly playable.

[Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) is another app for streaming games.
It's an open-source implementation of Nvidia's GameStream technology, the same
one behind the Nvidia Shield. In my experience, Moonlight has less input lag
than Steam Link. I have both Steam Link and Moonlight installed on my tablet,
and I use either depending on the situation.

- Moonlight has lower input lag.
- Steam Link has better on-screen controls.
- Steam Link has a better user interface.
- Steam Link has _different_ mouse emulation; I prefer Steam Link's, but this is up to user preference.

By default I choose Steam Link, because the games I intend to play on my tablet
are inherently not frame sensitive anyway. For the occasional game where I want
a little less input lag, I'll use Moonlight instead.

So far I'm extremely satisfied with this setup. I have quite a backlog of games
in my library that I want to play, but am not so keen on playing it while
sitting on my PC. Typically these are narrative-heavy or casual games.

## Games I've played

### [Coromon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1218210/Coromon/)

Works well with on-screen controller buttons. Feels slightly better on
Moonlight with the lower input lag, but Moonlight has worse on-screen
controller buttons, so you have to pick your tradeoffs.

### [Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/)

Works well with touch controls. Input lag is not noticeable at all. The game
makes use of right-click as a back button, and I prefer Steam Link's back
button interaction. On the Steam Link a right-click is a tap with two fingers,
on Moonlight it's a tap and hold with one finger. The two finger tap is faster,
but maybe a little less ergonomic for some.
