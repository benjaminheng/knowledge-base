title: "Knowledge Base"

Hello, this is my knowledge base! This site is a companion to my
[blog](https://hbenjamin.com/post/). Here I record my thoughts, links,
resources, and various things I find interesting. You can also think of this
space as a [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a
> blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in
> public.

Notes in this space are often only minimally formatted. In many cases, they're
nothing more than link dumps. The intention is to have my notes publicly
available so others may also learn from them.
