// TODO: recipe under development

- **Serves:** ?
- **Time:** ? minutes

## Ingredients

- 250ml beef stock
- 500g beef cubes
- 15g gelatin
- 30g tomato paste
- 50g frozen peas
- 150g onions; diced
- 250g carrots; sliced
- 150g celery; sliced
- 250g potatoes; diced
- Mixed spices

## Directions

- Put all ingredients into a pot.
- Pressure cook for 30 minutes

## TODO

- Experiment with different timings
- Experiment with freezing the stew. How does it hold up after a couple weeks?
  Do the potatoes need to be frozen separately?
- Is gelatin a decent substitute for flour? 
- Experiment with mushrooms. I find that mushrooms don't reheat well, but worth another try.
- Iteration 1:
    - Bit too watery. Reduce stock from 500ml to 250ml. Might require some
      flour too.
    - 30 minute pressure cook is good. Consider reducing to 25 minutes if
      planning to freeze.
    - Potatoes are fine but might be a bit soft given that I'll be freezing and
      reheating it. Consider cooking potatoes separately next time?
    - Taste is excellent. No additional seasoning required.
    - Increase carrots from 200g to 250g.
