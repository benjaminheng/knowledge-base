title: Stardew Valley
---

Stardew Valley is about more than just farming. You fish, mine, rear animals,
build relationships, marry, explore, and yes, make money. These systems are all
extremely fleshed out.

There are multiple ways to construct a profitable farm. Be a bee keeper and
sell honey. Place a ton of tappers on trees to collect their sap. Harvest
fruits and make wine. Make beer and ale instead. Rear animals and sell their
products. Or just straight up farm crops to sell.

The world feels alive and populated. The villagers have their own schedules and
you often see them going about their day. After a while you get to know more
about each character, and they're often deeper than would appear!

As you become more liked by the residents of Stardew Valley (by giving them
gifts!), you'll trigger little cutscenes with them. These cutscenes and
interactions do a really good job in making it feel like your relationship
building efforts are actually doing something. It's this sense of progression
that keeps the game from feeling like you're just raising an arbitrary stat to
get a certain ending.

Speaking of progression, Stardew Valley's pacing is particularly well done.
When you start the game for the first time, it doesn't hold your hand and lead
you through a step-by-step tutorial. You get some seeds, basic farming
instructions, and off you go. Then you're given an initial quest to meet the
villagers. That's all you really need. Each new feature or system that comes up
is organically introduced and explained. You never reach a point where you have
to wonder, "well now what do I do?".

Wholeheartedly recommend. I feel a little guilty paying just $15 for this.
