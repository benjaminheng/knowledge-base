## Siem Reap

Siem Reap is a short flight from Bangkok; consider adding Siem Reap on as a 2
or 3 day side trip if you're in Bangkok. Siem Reap doesn't have good flight
connectivity to other parts of Thailand though, so you'll need to layover in
Bangkok.

### Accommodation

- [Babel Guesthouse](https://www.babelsiemreap.com/)

### Things to do

- Angkor Wat and surrounding temples
- Phare Circus

### Angkor Wat

Be sure to buy a ticket from the [ticket
counter](https://goo.gl/maps/7cL69Nmj1HLPFcgs9) before heading to the temples.
Tickets bought after 5pm start their validity period from the next day.

Cycling around Angkor is feasible. Bike rentals can go as low as $1/day. Bring lots of water and pack a lunch.

There are two circuits that take you around Angkor's temples, a small and big
one. [Here's some information about the temples along each circuit, as well as a
map of the circuit
itself](https://helloangkor.com/navigating-angkors-temples-the-small-circuit-the-grand-circuit-map-guide/).
The distance from Charles De Gaulle to Angkor Wat is about 8km. The distance of
the small circuit is 17km, and the large circuit 40km.

### Cycling around Siem Reap

**Tonle Sap** lake is about 12km down the NR63 road. A perhaps quieter route is
along Psar Kraoum Road. Along the way there's a small temple, Wat Athvear.
Further down is Phnom Kraom. Both temples require the Angkor pass. Here's a [possible route](https://www.bikemap.net/en/r/3589647/).

**West Baray** reservoir. About a 40km ride. Part of the ride goes along the
very busy NR6. [Here's a possible
route](https://www.bikemap.net/en/r/4164468/).
