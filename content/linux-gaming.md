## Trails in the Sky FC

- Proton 9.x
- Run using directx 8

## Trails in the Sky SC

- Proton 9.x
- Run dx8 configuration tool. Will have a black screen. Hit enter to start the game. It's probably triggering the "start" game button in the UI that we can't see.
- Subsequently the game can be launched by selecting "run using dx8".
- Resolution will probably be initialized to 640x480. Since we can't use the configuration tool, and the resolution can't be changed in game, we have to update the resolution in the config file.
