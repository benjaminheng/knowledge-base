## Wahoo Bolt v2

Likes:

- E-ink screen is easy to read.
- Screen is small and isn't too distracting during rides.

Dislikes:

- Beeping cannot be completely disabled. Beeps are too loud. Beeping can't be easily silenced because there's no specific speaker hole; the entire device body is poorly soundproofed, so the sound is emitted from the entire body.
- Screen is perhaps a little smaller than I would like for navigation. It's not always easy to make out upcoming turns from a quick glance down.
- The point-to-point routing isn't the best. Often doesn't prioritize park connectors. Instead I use brouter, export to GPX, and upload to the bike computer.
