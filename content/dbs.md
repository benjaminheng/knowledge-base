## Unblock Google Play transaction

DBS blocks all Google Play Store transactions. To unblock a transaction, you need to call the DBS hotline. They will lift the block temporarily for 24 hours. It's incredibly annoying having to do this frequently.

Their hotline is designed to mislead customers into dropping off. Here's the sequence to use in order to get to a support agent. The numbers can be entered without waiting for the voice to finish speaking, so if you know the sequence, you can more quickly get through to an agent.

```
1               - English
1               - General enquiries
<NRIC_DIGITS>#
1               - Confirm
[WAIT]          - OTP will be sent
<OTP>#
[WAIT]          - Don't select "credit card transactions", it's dead end. Instead just wait.
*0              - Speak to customer service agent
2               - Credit card services
[WAIT]          - Don't fall their nonsense about long wait times. The agent picks up within seconds. Just wait here.
```

The script I use is typically:

> Hi, I'm trying to make a Google Play Store transaction. I understand it's being blocked for security reasons. Can you temporarily lift this block so I can make the transaction?

The agent will ask for your full name, and for the credit card you're trying to make a transaction on. They will then submit a request to lift the block. Try to make the transaction again after 30 minutes or so and it should work.
