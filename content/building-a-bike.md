I'm currently in the process of building a bike. This page will contain my
research notes. It is going to be very unstructured.

## Build

- Frame: Surly Cross-Check 50cm (TODO: color?)
- Brakes: 
- Brake pads: Kool Stop Supra 2, Salmon

## Research

### Frame

- Surly Cross-Check. Either 50cm or 52cm. Leaning towards 50cm.

### Brakes

- [Mini V-Brakes vs. Cantilever Brakes â€“ Advantages and Disadvantages Compared](https://brainybiker.com/mini-v-brakes-vs-cantilever-brakes-advantages-and-disadvantages-compared/)
- Probably will get mini-v or v brakes. Stronger and easier to set up and maintain.
- Leaning towards mini-v, but need to do more research.
- Mini-v will require a short-pull brake lever.

Options:

- (Canti) Avid Shorty Ultimate. Expensive, but possibly worth it? Since I'm not
  intending to go for disc brakes, might be worth spending more on quality rim
  brakes.
- (V) Shimano Deore BR-T610 V-Brake. https://www.bike-components.de/en/Shimano/Deore-BR-T610-V-Brake-Set-p83063/
- (Mini-V) Tektro RX6 https://www.tektro.com/products.php?p=49

Brake pads:

-  Kool stop salmon
