Love it. Bought it on a whim and was hooked within the first half hour.

The tutorialization is really good. Gradually introduces new concepts and eases
the player into the flow of things. The campaign (called "training" levels
in-game) is of excellent quality as well. I appreciated the heavy
tutorialization that introduced the level editor, as someone without prior
experience in the genre.

Speaking of the level editor, I found it intuitive to use. Had no issues with
designing and building a level.

Though what really stands out to me is the level discoverability. Levelhead has
a really smart system that incentives players to play newly-created levels made
by other players. Essentially new levels get put into the "marketing
department", and you earn "exposure bucks" from playing other player-created
levels. These bucks can be spent on your own levels to increase its visibility.

The end result is a happy little feedback loop where you're incentived to play
other players' levels, and other players' are incentivized to play yours. It's
quite rewarding when the levels you so painstakingly build get played by
others.

And finally... there are so many great levels by the community! Lots of very
unique creations, which is also testament to the robust level editor.

Would absolutely recommend Levelhead to anyone even remotely interested in
platformers.
