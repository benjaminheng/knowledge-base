## Route planning

**[BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/)**. OSM-based. Very customizable. Intuitive route planning. My current go-to for route planning.

**[OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/)**. Just an overlay over OSM; no routing capabilities. UI is fast. Information is clearly displayed. Mostly useful just for high level exploration.

**[OpenRouteService](https://maps.openrouteservice.org)**. OSM-based. Uses the CyclOSM overlay. Less customizable compared to BRouter. Route suggestions are not as complete, because you can't customize your preference cycling paths. A few annoying UI quirks.

**[RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/new)**. OSM-based. One of the better route planners. Requires an account to save and export, probable dealbreaker.
