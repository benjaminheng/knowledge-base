### Poached eggs

Attempt 1:

- Process:
    - Brand of eggs: Chew's
    - Strained loose whites using strainer.
    - Small amount of vinegar in water.
    - Lowered gently into barely boiling pot. No vortex.
    - Spatula to gently scoop whites towards the yolk
    - Didn't measure the time spent cooking.
- Results:
    - Whites ran away a little. Most stayed with the yolk. Yolk wasn't uniformly encased in the whites.
    - I think the whites separated from the yolk a little before I lowered it into the pot.
    - Yolk was a little too hard. Can be more runny.
- Takeaways:
    - Get a slotted spoon to minimize number of utensils to wash.
    - Practice straining the egg through my fingers, to avoid having to wash the strainer.
    - Lightly salt the water.
    - Try a different brand of eggs.
    - Cook for less time for a more runny yolk.
