An excellent game with interesting puzzles and a very compelling story.

The subtitle, "Digital detective adventure", is an apt description for the
game. The puzzles are the investigative sort, with logical solutions. Most
puzzles will involve reading emails/documents and looking at photographs for
clues. Some have little minigames and physical interactions as well. The
puzzles aren't straightforward either; you're typically required to take down
notes, and the game helpfully provides a little notepad for you. I particularly
enjoy the puzzles because often they're about some real-world scenario, whether
it's solving a murder case or preventing some disaster. There's an overarching
story as well, and each puzzle you solve is in some way tied to it.

As for the story, I must say I was hooked within the first 15 minutes. I
honestly didn't expect such a compelling story! The story is presented in the
form of text and email conversations, and it works surprisingly well. The
"boring" nature of text conversations is enhanced by a rather interesting input
mechanism. It's a little hard to explain coherently via text, but let's say
that it introduces some interactivity to the act of advancing dialog.

There is a demo available. Honestly I only played it halfway before I went and
purchased the game, but I think I can assume where the demo stops. I think
it'll provide a good indication of what the game will be like. Highly recommend
checking out the demo if what I've written above interests even in the
slightest.
