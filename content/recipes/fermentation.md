- [On fermenting garlic honey safely](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/q3z46v/concerned_about_fermenting_garlic_in_honey/hfwaz9x/)
- Leftover pulp when fermenting hot sauces can be dehydrated and crushed into chilli flakes, or ground into powder.

Ingredient ideas:
- Pickled ginger, for a milder ginger kick.
- Confit onion. Will have a lot of sugars to get the fermentation started.
