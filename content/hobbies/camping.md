Just some initial exploration to build a cheap camping setup. However I'm quite discouraged with all the restrictions placed upon camping in Singapore. Not leaving the tent unattended, which affects solo campers. No open flame, even a controlled flame from a butane stove. Camping being restricted to certain locations.
