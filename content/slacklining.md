## Slackline spots in Singapore

- East Coast Park: https://goo.gl/maps/4iZkasqLros7rSn67 (training shed, benches, palm trees, nice grass, next to footpath)
- Bedok Reservoir Park: https://goo.gl/maps/2VqKmArNKuuW1Syy6 (near Forest Adventure, relatively secluded, well shaded)

## Primitive rig minimum requirements

- 20m+ of webbing. Ideally with sewn loops.
- 3x carabiners. Preferably locking and made of steel. Three biners needed for an ellington tensioning setup.
- 1x steel shackle.
- 1-2x rappel rings. To build a line locker. One will do, but two will increase the bend radius and thus decrease fatigue on the webbing.
- 2x anchor slings. 2m long at least.
- 2x tree protection. Towels will do.

## On steel vs aluminum carabiners

- [Steel has an finite fatigue limit, aluminum does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_limit). Having a fatigue limit means that below a certain load threshold, an infinite number of loading cycles can be applied without causing fatigue failure.
- [Steel has higher tensile strength](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334898123_Materials_types_and_selection_for_carabiners_manufacturing_a_review).
- [Steel wears less than aluminum](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.869.7869&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
