## Route planning

*[OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/)*. Just an overlay over OSM; no routing capabilities. UI is fast. Information is clearly displayed. Mostly useful just for high level exploration.

*[BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/)*. OSM-based. Very customizable. Intuitive route planning. GPS/KML exports.
