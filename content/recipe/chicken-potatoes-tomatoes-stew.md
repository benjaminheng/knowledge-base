serves: 2
time: 45 minutes
ingredients:
    - 4 chicken thighs or drumsticks
    - 1 can of tomatoes
    - 1 diced onion
    - 6 baby potatoes
    - Assorted frozen vegetables
steps:
    - Add chicken parts, onions, potatoes, frozen vegetables to a pressure cooker.
    - Add canned tomatoes, without liquid
    - Add salt and pepper, mix thoroughly
    - Pressure cook for 25 minutes
notes:
    - Ingredient amounts are rough. Add more or less of each ingredient based
      on your preference.
    - Frozen and canned goods can be replaced with fresh ones; I used
      frozen/canned because I'm optimizing for convenience
