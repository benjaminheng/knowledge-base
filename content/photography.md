### III vs IIIx

This section synthesizes opinions gathered from users across Reddit and other forums.

The primary difference between the two models is the focal length. The GR III has a 28m focal length, whereas the IIIx has a 40mm focal length. The IIIx will thus have a tighter frame. As a practical demonstration, if you were to take a photo of someone across a table, the GR III would be able to do so with part of the table in frame, whereas with the IIIx, you'll need to get up from the table to take a step back.

With the IIIx, you'll be able to shoot from a further distance from the subject. This could be beneficial in street photography, due to the added stealth. On the other hand, due to the wider FoV of the III, it's possible to get the subject in the frame without pointing the camera straight at them, which provides another form of stealth.

The IIIx is generally considered more suitable for portraits. The larger focal length allows for a shallower depth of field, which provides the bokeh effect commonly desired in portraits. The wider depth of field of the III can be desirable in situations where you want a large portion of the image in focus. For cases where you want most (or all) of the frame in focus while maintaining proper exposure, the III is more forgiving.

As an everyday or travel camera, consensus is split between the two models. Some of the common arguments include:

- For IIIx:
    - 40mm is different from the typical smartphone. For photos requiring a wider FoV, use your phone instead.
    - The tighter frame makes it easier to compose scenes.
    - For landscapes, the tigher frame allows you to isolate interesting features in the overall view.
- For III:
    - The wider frame is better for indoor shots, where you might not have space to back up.
    - The wider frame allows you to shoot while being in the scene. With the IIIx, you might have to back up to get the subject in the frame, which takes you out of the scene.
    - For landscapes, the wider frame allows you to take in the whole view.
    - The wider frame allows portraits to contain more context. Rather than taking a headshot, the frame can include a part of the background.
    - If a tighter frame is required, you can shoot in 35mm crop mode, giving a 16MP image, which is still plenty.
