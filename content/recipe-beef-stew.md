// TODO: recipe under development

- **Serves:** ?
- **Time:** ? minutes

## Ingredients

- 500ml beef stock
- 500g beef cubes
- 50g frozen peas
- ?g onions; diced
- 15g gelatin
- 30g tomato paste
- 200g carrots
- 150g celery
- 250g potatoes
- Mixed spices

## Directions

- Pressure cook for 30 minutes

## TODO

- Compare beef stock vs chicken stock.
- Tomato paste can probably be substituted with fresh, but paste keeps for longer.
- Experiment with different timings
- Experiment with freezing the stew. How does it hold up after a couple weeks?
  Do the potatoes need to be frozen separately?
- Is gelatin a decent substitute for flour? 
- Experiment with mushrooms. I find that mushrooms don't reheat well, but worth another try.
