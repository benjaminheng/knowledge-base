title: "Knowledge Base"
---

Hello, this is my knowledge base! Here I record my thoughts, links, resources,
and various things I find interesting. You can also think of this space as a
[digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a
> blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in
> public.

Articles linked in the knowledge base are archived
[here](https://github.com/benjaminheng/link-archive) for posterity. More
information about the knowledge base can be found in this
[post](about-this-knowledge-base). I also have a
[blog](https://hbenjamin.com/post/) on my main website.
