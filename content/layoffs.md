title: "Layoffs"
---

[Carousell laid off 10% of its total headcount in
December](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/carousell-cuts-110-jobs-to-rein-in-costs).
While I wasn't laid off, the layoffs has had more of an emotional impact on
myself than I would have expected.

What I found unexpected is how gutted I feel on behalf of those who got laid
off. Whenever we think of layoffs, we probably think about it from a
self-centered perspective. We think about it from our perspective and how we
would feel if we got laid off. We don't think about how it feels to _not_ be
laid off, but have your friends and colleagues be.

It sucks, and it sucks more than I thought it would. There are so many talented
people being let go, whether they've been around for 6 months or 6 years.

There's a noticeable drop in mood across the company. It sounds obvious to say,
but it's one thing to imagine it from a place of safety and another to
experience it. I can't quite place the emotions being felt, it's probably a
combination of worry for our own job security, guilt at being lucky enough to
avoid the layoffs, and a plain emphathetic response on behalf of those laid
off.
