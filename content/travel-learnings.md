## Summary

Here are various learnings I've gathered thus far, in no particular order.
These learnings are not universal, just what works for me.

1. Bring an ereader. If you have to cut things from your bag to make space, do
   it.
2. A powerbank is essential.
3. Get comfortable shoes for walking. Walking is much more tiring than you'd
   expect.
4. A day bag is sometimes invaluable. Use it for water and a powerbank at
   minimum.
5. Onebag travel is great. A 20L bag is sufficient for a tropical climate,
   assuming no sporting equipment.
6. A bifold wallet makes it easier to manage physical money.
7. Paying more for convenience is sometimes worth it.
8. Food tourism works much better when travelling with someone. Your appetite
   limits the number of different foods you can try.
9. Consider purchasing a late checkout or an extra night if your departing
   flight is late in the day.
10. You'll make mistakes. And then you'll get over it.
11. Merino wool is fantastic for travel.

## Trips

Here are learnings from specific trips.

### Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2022

**You'll make mistakes.** And then you'll get over it. This is especially true
when you solo travel. You just don't have someone else to bounce ideas off of.
I had one early in my trip, before the bus ride from the airport into the city.
The bus had just arrived, and the driver wandered off for a few minutes. After
a bit discussion, myself and some other passengers decided that it's _probably_
ok to just board the bus. After a while the driver returned and started
shouting for us to alight. Fun start to the trip. Not a big deal, but that's
the point; mistakes are part of travel.

**Bring an ereader.** I omitted my ereader to make space for my climbing gear.
I could have still fitted it in, but it would have been quite overpacked. In
hindsight I should have definitely brought it. There were loads of times where
I wish I had a book to read to pass the time. There were some meals where I
wanted to read while eating, because reading a book is more enjoyable than
scrolling through online forums on my phone.

**You probably should bring a powerbank.** While I don't think it's always
necessary, it can come in handy. At one point I found myself much too low on
battery. I had an event at night I wanted to go to, but the only feasible to
travel back from the event was via Grab. I wasn't confident that I would have
enough battery at the end of the night to call a Grab, so I opted not to go to
the event.

**Consider bringing a day bag.** At minimum it'll provide a convenient way to
carry some water and a powerbank with you.

**My money management could be better.** I've forgotten how annoying dealing
with physical money can be. In Singapore I hardly ever use physical money
anymore. I used a credit card sized wallet and had to fold the bills. Super
annoying whenever I needed to take money out. I should prioritize getting a
compact bifold for travel.

**It's nice to buy conveniences sometimes.** I took the bus from the airport,
and the train when departing back to the airport. The train costs about SGD$18,
while the bus costs $5. An extra $10 is a small enough absolute value that it
doesn't really matter. We're fortunatey to have such disposable income, and
it's nice to exploit it once in a while.

**Walking around is much more tiring than I expected.** After the first day my
knees and feet were already hurting. I took it easy the second day, spending a
lazy afternoon in a museum. I should get more comfortable shoes for travel.

**One bag travel is fantastic.** I brought a 28L bag. Most of it was filled
with climbing gear; harness, shoes, rack, helmet, chalk bag. My clothes took up
less than 20% of the total capacity. I could easily travel indefinitely in a
tropical country with a 20L bag, since there would be no need for cold weather
clothes. I imagine it's a lot less stressful to simply have a small bag, rather
than lugging around massive suitcases.

**Merino wool and other technical fabrics are fantastic.** Merino wool is known
for being extremely odor resistant. I wore mine walking around in a hot day,
then during a downpour at night, and again on the last day at the airport. On
my second day I wore a regular cotton shirt I had, and it was so much less
comfortable. Until then I didn't appreciate how much work my merino shirt was
doing to wick away moisture.

**Food tourism is difficult for solo travellers.** There were times I wanted to
try more food options, but simply didn't have the appetite to do so.

**Kuala Lumpur isn't that exciting to me.** Well, apart from the climbing
anyway. I probably wouldn't visit KL again unless I can tack on a climbing
session during the trip.
