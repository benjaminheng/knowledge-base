## Basic

- **Hello**: *sa-wat-dee khrap*.
    - Append *khrap* (as male), or *ka* (as female). The appended terms are
      used for formality or politeness, often when greeting strangers.
      *sa-wat-dee* may be casually spoken as *sa-wa-dee* instead.
- **Thank you**: *khawp khun*.
    - For more formality, append *khrap*/*ka*.
- **Yes/No**:
    - Yes and no is a bit complicated in Thai. The verb from the question needs
      to be repeated to mean yes, and "*mai* <verb>" to mean no. Requires a
      deeper understanding of the language to effectively use yes and no
      appropriately.

## Food

- **Chicken**: *gai*
- **Beef**: *nuua wuua* (meat of cow)
- **Pork**: *nuua muu* (meat of pig)

Notes:

- *nuua* means meat, so different types of meat can be referred to as "meat of
  <animal>". For example, beef is *nuua wuua*, which means "meat of cow".
  Simply saying *wuua* (cow) sounds strange; in English it would be like saying
  you want to eat a cow. However notice that chicken can be referred to as
  simply *gai* instead of *nuua gai*, because chicken is both a term for the
  meat and the animal.
