## Baking

- Using a [Sona SMO 23A toaster oven](https://www.sona.com.sg/smo-23a-10l-mini-oven), 145C on the dial
  corresponds to 130C internal temperature.
- Do a few test runs with a baking thermometer to calibrate your oven; the
  temperature usually doesn't exactly match the value on the dial.
- [Glass Attic page on baking](https://www.glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm)
- Sculpey Premo baking instructions: 135 degrees C for 30 minutes per quarter
  inch of thickness.
- If not pre-heating, remember to add an additional 10 minutes or so to allow
  the oven to get up to temperature.
- Place the item on a piece of parchment paper to avoid shiny spots where the
  item touches the surface it is baking on.
- Cover the item with a tent of aluminum foil to keep the temperature
  consistent, since the oven will cycle the heating elements on and off.

## Conditioning hard/crumbly clay

Some clays can be very hard. When pulled, it might crumble rather than stretch.
The hardness of clay could be due to age or having been stored in a hot
environment. No amount of rolling or folding will condition this clay. To do so
we need to add additional agents to it.

Some options you could add:

- Official products like Sculpey clay softener
- Liquid clay
- Mineral oil
- Vaseline or petroleum jelly

Personally I use mineral oil. It's often marketed as baby oil and can be found
in pharmacies or supermarkets. Ideally you want one that's unscented, but
either will work. If buying baby oil, make sure the ingredients list contains
only mineral oil. For scented baby oil, the ingredients list may contain
"fragrance" -- this is fine.

Here's my method using mineral oil:

- Break the clay into small pieces, the smaller the better.
- Put the pieces in a ziploc bag.
- Add a few drops of mineral oil.
- Shake the bag to coat.
- Massage from outside the bag to work the oil into the clay. This prevents
  your hands from getting coated with oil.
- Use your hands to finish working the clay. By the point the clay would have
  absorbed the oil, so your hands wouldn't get as oily.

A little mineral oil goes a long way. The amount of oil to add depends on the
amount of clay you have and how hard it is. Start with 3-5 drops, and add more
as needed.
