This is more of a technique than a specific recipe. Essentially it involves
wrapping all the ingredients up in foil and baking it in the oven.

For the base, carrots, onions, mushrooms, and other hardy vegetables will work
well. Add your choice of protein, which for instance could be chicken, minced
beef, or fish. Carbs like potatoes will be nice too.

- Add the ingredients to a large piece of aluminum foil.
- Drizzle some olive oil and toss to coat.
- Add salt, pepper, and other seasonings
- Wrap in at two layers of foil. More layers require more baking time.
- Bake at 200c for about 30 minutes. Timing will vary based on your choice of
  protein.
    - Chicken breast: 30-40min, or until 74c internal temperature.
    - Salmon: 20min

Some other notes:

- A small amount of red wine can add depth of flavor.
- Try to add some sort of fat. Skin-on chicken or bacon, for instance.
- Add two slices of lemon (or lime) for a bit of brightness.
- This is a great meal-prep recipe. Consider storing prepped ingredients in a
  ziploc bag. You can use this pre-prepped ingredients for a quick meal in the
  future.
