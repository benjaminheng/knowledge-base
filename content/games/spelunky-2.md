## True ending?

Still exploring. Not sure yet.

### 1-x (Caves)

Get the Udjat Eye from either 1-2 or 1-3.

### 2-x (Jungle or Volcana)

Go to either Jungle or Volcana.

- If Jungle, get the Hedjet from the black market.
- If Volcana, get the crown from Dracula's castle.

Get Huo Yi's bow from the Moon Challenge.

### 3-1 (Olmec)

Deposit Huo Yi's bow with the Waddler.

Drop Olmec into the lava. Get the Ankh.

### 4-x (Tide Pool or Temple)

Go to either the Tide Pool or Temple. Ankh is required for this.

**Tide Pool:**

On 4-2, get the sword. Must have Hedjet or crown to do so.

On 4-3, find the entrance to the "well" leading to the one-way door under the lava. Before entering, drop sword/backpack. Disturb the idol under the lava. Lava will drop and you will die. A door will be exposed from the dropped lava. Respawn from the Ankh. Collect dropped sword/backpack. Find and enter door exposed by the dropped lava.

On 4-4 (Abzu?), kill the turtle guy. Easiest to do so with the sword. If no sword, 10 bombs are required to crack the shell. Once cracked, shell can be damaged with whip or other weapons. 

Get the tablet that drops from the boss.

**Temple:**

On 4-1, kill Anubis. Two bombs will kill him. Take his scepter.

On 4-2, use the scepter to enter the City of Gold. Must have Hedjet or crown to do so.

On 4-3 (City of Gold): find the altar. Fall onto altar to sacrifice self. Must not be cursed. Must have at least 1 hp. Try to fall vertically; you must be stunned on the alter to be sacrificed.

On 4-4 (Duat): Kill Osiris. `// TODO: need a strategy here`

Get the tablet that drops from the boss.

### 5-1 (Ice Caves)

Nothing needed on this level. Head to the exit. Grab spike shoes or a compass from the Wet Fur caves if needed.

### 6-x  (Neo-babylon)

On 6-2, find the entrance to the figurine room. Use the tablet to figure out which figurine to take. Bring the figurine to 6-3.

On 6-3, if correct figurine is chosen, the figurine will hatch into a mount. Bring the mount to 6-4.

On 6-4, ignore Tiamat. Use the mount to head up past the lasers. Enter door at the top.

### 7-x

`// TODO: this section needs work. Haven't fully discovered this part yet.`

On 7-1, find Waddler and retrieve Huo Yi's bow. Get the arrow from the Sun challenge.

Sun challenge strategy: Whichever direction you start the challenge, head forward and diagonally upwards. For instance if facing east, head northeast. In the corner will be a spear trap and a mob spawner. Bomb the spawner and stand above the trap. Mobs should hopefully be unable to reach you.

On 7-4, kill Hundun. Once dead, shoot arrow into eye.

## Boss strategies

### Olmec (phase 2)

- Let Olmec shoot bombs till about 3min or 2-3 passes.
- Sticky bombs: Safest. Throw at thrusters.
- Shotgun: Make sure to account for knockback when shooting.
- Boomerang: Be patient and use ropes wisely.
- Ice gun: Be very, very, very patient.
- None of the above: give up and do a normal run.

### Tiamat

- Sticky bombs: drop bombs on bubbles to cook them. Throw cooked bombs at boss after a second or two. `// TODO: how many bombs required?`
- Shotgun: Just shoot
- `// TODO: what to do if neither of the above are available?`

### Hundun

`// TODO: I don't know how to defeat this boss yet`

## Mothership

In 5-1 (Ice Caves), there's a door at the bottom of the level, one block below the boundary. Door placement is random. Hoverpack can be used to find the door. Alternatively there's an alien compass that will point to the door, but I haven't figured out how to get that yet. In the mothership is a plasma cannon.

## Sparrow quest

1. Steal from a shopkeeper in 1-x. Take an item and run out. Must not use a rope on the shopkeeper.
2. In 2-1, Sparrow can be found in the 2nd layer through a wooden door.

`// TODO: haven't verified the following yet, this is a hypothesis`

- In 4-x, enter Tusk's backroom. Should be an idol there?
- Take the idol to 6-1 maybe?
