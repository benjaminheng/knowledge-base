I'm currently in the process of building a bike. This page will contain my
research notes. It is going to be very unstructured.

## Build

- Frame: Surly Cross-Check 52cm (TODO: color?)
- Brakes: TRP CX8.4 (Mini-V)
- Brake pads: Kool Stop Supra 2, Salmon

## Research

### Frame

- Surly Cross-Check 52cm

### Brakes

- [Mini V-Brakes vs. Cantilever Brakes â€“ Advantages and Disadvantages Compared](https://brainybiker.com/mini-v-brakes-vs-cantilever-brakes-advantages-and-disadvantages-compared/)
- Probably will get mini-v or v brakes. Stronger and easier to set up and maintain.
- Leaning towards mini-v, but need to do more research.
- Mini-v will require a short-pull brake lever.

Options:

- (Canti) Avid Shorty Ultimate. Expensive, but possibly worth it? Since I'm not
  intending to go for disc brakes, might be worth spending more on quality rim
  brakes.
- (V) Shimano Deore BR-T610 V-Brake. https://www.bike-components.de/en/Shimano/Deore-BR-T610-V-Brake-Set-p83063/
- (Mini-V) Tektro RX6 https://www.tektro.com/products.php?p=49
- (Mini-V) TRP CX8.4 https://global.bluelug.com/trp-cx8-4-mini-v-brake-black.html

Brake pads:

-  Kool stop salmon

### Crankset

- SRAM Rival 1 (1x11)

### Bottom brackets

- SRAM GXP A1 https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/bb-gxp-a1

### Groupsets

- Shimano Deore XT (1x11)
- Shimano Deore M5100 (1x11)

### Chainring

Before selecting a chainring, know what the BCD is of your crankset.

- Wolf Tooth https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainrings/chain-compatibility_all-9-10-11spd

### Handlebars

Would like something with different hand positions. My hands tend to get tingly
after prolonged riding.  More hand positions would be nice. Not interested in
drop bars.

- Jones H-Bar
- Surly Moloko handlebar -- a bit of a weird design, probably overkill in terms of hand positions

## Tools to buy

- Torque wrench
- See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/uzh01n/was_lucky_enough_to_find_a_crosscheck_in_my_size/iab6lrj/) for more

## Random questions

- What's the difference between short/medium/long cage derailleurs? When would
  you use each?
- What gear ratios do I want or need? Need to decide this before we choose the
  cassette and front chainring size. Use sheldon brown's calculator.

## Random notes

- Consider Shimano Deore for the cassette and possibly other components as
  well. Seems to be generally regarded and having good quality for the price.
- For cranksets, aesthetics is one of my main factor. I'm not a fan of how
  Shimano cranksets look. I might use a SRAM crankset instead while using
  Shimano for the cassette.
- TODO: look into price difference between 10 speed and 11 speed groupsets. 11
  speed is definitely overkill for SG, but if it's not too much more expensive
  I might go for that. Otherwise I'll stick to 10 speed.
- Not sure if I should be concerned about toe overlap. Seems to be a common
  complaint about the Surly CC/Straggler.

## Inspirations

- Black frame, silver crankset/seatpost/headset. Brown leather accents. https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/mcictw/crosscheck/
- Black frame, silver crankset/seatpost/headset. Tan rims. https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/o3b282/my_crosscheck_with_some_freshly_built_wheels/
- Black on black. I like the tan rims on a black bike. https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/mcictw/crosscheck/gs60f6f/
