    - Rule of thumb for estimating length of thread is 3 times the length of the stitch line. Increases based on leather thickness.
    - Coat with beeswax to give the thread strength and keeps from fraying. Beeswax is a little sticky, so it helps to go over it with some paraffin wax, but this is optional.
    - Use a soft cloth to remove excess. Run it through firmly to remove excess as well as remove the curl from the spool. Apply paraffin wax if available, and gently wipe off.
    - Video shows two ways of stitching. One where it's angled on one side and straight on the back. Another where it's angled on both sides.
    - See video for how to finish a stitch using three back-stitches
