## Ingredients

- 450ml beef stock
- 500g beef cubes
- 15g gelatin
- 30g tomato paste
- 50g frozen peas
- 150g onions; diced
- 250g carrots; sliced
- 150g celery; sliced
- 250g potatoes; diced
- Mixed spices

## Directions

- Put all ingredients into a pot.
- Pressure cook for 25 minutes
- Slow release for 10 minutes

## Notes

- I recommend making this to freeze and reheat for meals later. The stew is a
  little watery immediately after cooking, but thickens up after being
  reheated.
- Consider bread or rice on the side.
