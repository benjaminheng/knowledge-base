I'm currently in the process of building a bike. This page will contain my
research notes. It is going to be very unstructured.

## Build

- Frame: Surly Cross-Check 52cm; black
- Brakes: TRP CX8.4 (Mini-V)
- Brake pads: Kool Stop Supra 2, Salmon
- Bottom Bracket: Shimano BB-UN300 (Square taper)
- Crank: Blue Lug RMC Multi Speed; Black; 165mm; 130 BCD
- Chainring: Wolf Tooth 42T Chainring; 130 BCD
- Cassette: Microshift Advent 9-speed 11-42 CS-H093A (alloy)
- Rear Derailleur: Microshift Advent 9-speed medium cage with clutch
- Shifters: Microshift Advent Trail Trigger Pro 1x9
- Chain: ??? 9 speed

## Research

### Frame

- Surly Cross-Check 52cm

### Brakes

- [Mini V-Brakes vs. Cantilever Brakes â€“ Advantages and Disadvantages Compared](https://brainybiker.com/mini-v-brakes-vs-cantilever-brakes-advantages-and-disadvantages-compared/)
- Probably will get mini-v or v brakes. Stronger and easier to set up and maintain.
- Leaning towards mini-v, but need to do more research.
- Mini-v will require a short-pull brake lever.

Options:

- (Canti) Avid Shorty Ultimate. Expensive, but possibly worth it? Since I'm not
  intending to go for disc brakes, might be worth spending more on quality rim
  brakes.
- (V) Shimano Deore BR-T610 V-Brake. https://www.bike-components.de/en/Shimano/Deore-BR-T610-V-Brake-Set-p83063/
- (Mini-V) Tektro RX6 https://www.tektro.com/products.php?p=49
- (Mini-V) TRP CX8.4 https://global.bluelug.com/trp-cx8-4-mini-v-brake-black.html

Brake pads:

-  Kool stop salmon

### Cranks

- [Blue Lug RMC Multi Speed; Black; 165mm; 130 BCD](https://global.bluelug.com/blue-lug-rmc-multi-speed-crank-all-blk.html) (Crank-BB interface: square taper)
- SRAM Rival 1 (1x11) (Crank-BB interface: GXP, 24/22mm axle)

I really like the aesthetics of White Industries, but they're too expensive to
be part of my initial build. Maybe as a future upgrade.
[Inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/v813eg/new_crank_day/).

- Cranks https://www.whiteind.com/product/square-taper-eno-cranks/
- Chainring https://www.whiteind.com/product/square-taper-eno-1x-tsr-chainrings/

Square taper cranks tend to be thinner, because the crank-BB interface is
thinner. A hollowtech II interface is wider, and therefore the crank has to
have more material surrounding the interface. I'm leanings towards a square
taper BB, since I prefer the aesthetics of thinner cranks.

### Bottom brackets

- Shimano BB-UN300 (Square taper)
- SRAM GXP A1 https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/bb-gxp-a1

### Freehub

Shimano hubs are generally regarded as somewhat silent hubs compared to other brands. For a truely silent hub, consider Onyx hubs.

- Shimano 105 FH-R7000
  [store](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/shimano105-r7000/FH-R7000.html),
  [sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZGvVKlFOoU) -- Seems reasonably, not too obnoxiously loud
- Onyx -- Very silent hubs

### Groupsets

- Shimano Deore M8000 (11 speed)
- Shimano SLX M7000 (11 speed)
- Shimano Deore XT (11 speed)
- Shimano Deore M5100 (11 speed)
- [Microshift Advent](https://www.microshift.com/products/groups/advent/) (9 speed)

### Cassette

I don't think I need a 11 speed for riding in mostly flat Singapore terrain. I
usually ride with 63 gear inches. A 10 speed 11-36 with a 42T chainring
provides provides similar gearing around that range. A 11 speed 11-42 is the
same as a 10-speed 11-36, but with one additional low gear.

- 11 speed 11-42: Shimano XT Cassette CS-M8000 11-speed
- 10 speed 11-36

## Wheels

- [bike24 filter](https://www.bike24.com/cycling/parts/bike-wheels?dynamicAttributes%5B72%5D%5B476%5D=476&dynamicAttributes%5B130%5D%5B767%5D=767&dynamicAttributes%5B129%5D%5B757%5D=757&searchTerm=&sort=) 

### Chainring

The chainring's BCD should match that of your cranks.

- Wolf Tooth https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainrings/chain-compatibility_all-9-10-11spd
- 130 BCD Wolf Tooth: https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainrings/products/130-bcd-cyclocross-chainrings?variant=14782015209507

### Handlebars

Would like something with different hand positions. My hands tend to get tingly
after prolonged riding.  More hand positions would be nice. Not interested in
drop bars.

- Jones H-Bar
- Surly Moloko handlebar -- a bit of a weird design, probably overkill in terms of hand positions

## Tools to buy

- Torque wrench
- Bottom bracket tool
- See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surlybikefans/comments/uzh01n/was_lucky_enough_to_find_a_crosscheck_in_my_size/iab6lrj/) for more

## Random questions

- What's the difference between short/medium/long cage derailleurs? When would
  you use each?
- What gear ratios do I want or need? Need to decide this before we choose the
  cassette and front chainring size. Use sheldon brown's calculator.

## Random notes

- Consider Shimano Deore for the cassette and possibly other components as
  well. Seems to be generally regarded and having good quality for the price.
- For cranksets, aesthetics is one of my main factor. I'm not a fan of how
  Shimano cranksets look. I might use a SRAM crankset instead while using
  Shimano for the cassette.
- TODO: look into price difference between 10 speed and 11 speed groupsets. 11
  speed is definitely overkill for SG, but if it's not too much more expensive
  I might go for that. Otherwise I'll stick to 10 speed.
- Not sure if I should be concerned about toe overlap. Seems to be a common
  complaint about the Surly CC/Straggler.
