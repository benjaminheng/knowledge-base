This page contains my various contingency plans when travelling abroad. The
plans may be tweaked based on my threat model for different destinations.

## General tips

- Bring backups where possible. Phones, credit cards, etc.
- Don't store the backup in the same place as the primary. Keep one card in
  your room, and one on your person.
- Store critical belongings on your person, not in a bag.
- Don't store critical belongings in the same place on your person. For
  example, don't use a phone case with a card holder; store both separately, in
  separate pockets.
- Depending on the threat model, consider more secure storage methods on your
  person. Zippered pockets, hidden clothing compartments, or pouches worn under
  your clothes.

## Preparing for the trip

Store the following on your phone. Store it on paper, in phone storage, in email, and in a cloud service.

- Flight tickets, or other transport tickets
- Insurance details
- Photo of passport
- Vaccination certificate, if applicable
- Address of your local embassy
- Passport-sized photos (in the event of a lost passport)

If you normally use a password manager with generated passwords, then passwords
to critical services like email should be changed to something memorable prior
to the trip.

## Lost phone

Keep a backup phone in hotel room. Log into email account using the backup phone
to retrieve your important documents.

## Lost passport

Contact your embassy. Depending on the country you are in, a police report may
need to be filed first.

## Lost credit card

Keep a backup credit card in hotel room. Use your phone to cancel the stolen card.

Depending on the country, bringing a physical card may be unnecessary if
contactless payments is common.

## Lost ID card

Contact your embassy. This is generally not a big deal.
