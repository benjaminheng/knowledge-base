## Pourover

- Grind size: 15 clicks on the Timemore C2.
- Pour technique:
    - 15g coffee, 250g water
    - Pour 50g water
    - Bloom for 40s
    - Pour in 50g increments, waiting 10s after each pour.
    - Lightly swirl water after final pour.
    - Wait until all water drips down. Total time should be around 3:15 minutes.

### Iced pourover

- 16g for a 250ml brew. Slightly more than 15g to account for loss of flavor from the colder temperature, and the dilution from ice melting.
- 40% ice, 60% hot water
- Bloom with 3x weight of coffee as water.
- Assuming a 250ml cup:
    - 15g coffee, 250g total water
    - Add 100g of ice.
    - Pour 40g water
    - Bloom for 40s
    - Pour remaining 110g of water gradually until 150g total. Stretch the brew to 2:30min
    - Serve over ice.
