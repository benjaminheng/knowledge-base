## Password mannager autofill no longer showing in Android 15

The autofill option defaults to using the suggestions strip in the Gboard keyboard. For those who want to keep suggestions disabled, the old autofill behavior might be re-enabled from your password manager's app. In Keepass2android, go to Settings > Password entry access > AutoFill Service and **disable** "Integrate with keyboard".
