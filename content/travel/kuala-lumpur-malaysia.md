## Getting there

Personally I would take the KLIA Transit/Ekspres to and from the airport. It
costs more at 55RM as opposed to 15RM for a bus ticket.

I've taken both the bus (Aerobus company) and the train. Both are comfortable.
The train will be more consistent, whereas with a bus the journey time will
vary based on traffic.

## Accommodation

- [citizenM Kuala Lumpur Bukit Bintang](https://www.booking.com/hotel/my/citizenm-kuala-lumpur-bukit-bintang.en-gb.html)
  - Fairly upscale. Not as much as a suite from a brand name hotel, but
  certainly more expensive than the average hotel.

## Weather

Dry season is from December to February.

## Guides for hire

I highly recommend [MIR Adventures](http://www.miradventures.com/).

Private group rates are 1 pax for 280RM ($90SGD), 2 pax for 188 RM/pax. Open
group rates are cheaper, at 150RM/pax, only available on weekends.

## Things to do

- [Jalan Alor night market](https://sethlui.com/jalan-alor-night-market-street-food-bukit-bintang-kuala-lumpur/).
  Best if you go in a group and eat at one of the roadside restaurants. There
  weren't many street food stalls.
- [Sangkaya ice cream at Jalan Alor](https://goo.gl/maps/X2wrtcGk7FVsFZNT7). I like the coconut and teh tarik flavors.
- [1 Utama](https://goo.gl/maps/27xvQTxnEyvpAdds6). Huge shopping mall. I got
  lost in there for a bit. I'm not a fan of malls, but if you are then you'll
  enjoy this place.
- [National Museum of Malaysia](https://g.page/national-museum-of-malaysia?share). Costs 5RM for
  foreigners. There's about 1-2 hours of content there. A little underwhelming,
  but worth the time on a lazy afternoon.
- Perdana Botanical Garden
- KLCC Park
- [BUMP Bouldering](https://www.bumpbouldering.com/)
- Camp5 @ 1Utama
- [Crackhouse Comedy Club](https://www.facebook.com/crackhousekl/). Headliners are
  usually on Fridays and weekends. Open mic nights on other days. Check their
  Facebook page for upcoming events.
- [Connaught night market](https://goo.gl/maps/YxZWBH2Q4RnLbZYQ8), only on Wednesday.
- [Batu Caves](https://goo.gl/maps/sMcridY2FoMLh5Fn9). I would deprioritize
  Batu Caves if you have other things to do in KL. There are lots of tourists
  around and the caves aren't that spectacular. Perhaps it was because I
  visited after climbing Damai Wall nearby; having been at the top of a wall
  just an hour before, it's not that interesting to view the same kind of wall
  from the bottom.
