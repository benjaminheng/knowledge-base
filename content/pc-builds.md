## Periodic stuttering

Some things to try if you experience periodic stuttering. I faced this when
using an AMD B450 Tomahawk Max motherboard. Every 15 seconds or so my system
would freeze for about 500ms, during which even the cursor would be
unresponsive.

- [Disable AMD Cool'n'Quiet](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/cej558/new_users_caution_with_amd_cool_n_quiet/) - This one worked for me
- [Disable fTPM](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1353904-amd-ftpm-causing-random-stuttering/).
- [Use Windows SATA device drivers instead of AMD ones](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1177546-windows-10-micro-stutters-with-ryzen/)
- Update BIOS
