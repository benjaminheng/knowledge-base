## Chiang Mai

### Getting there

Chiang Mai has an international airport. Scoot runs direct flights there.
Alternatively consider combining Bangkok and Chiang Mai in the same trip.

### Accommodation

I feel like the prices on booking.com are inflated. Probably can get cheaper
prices by booking in person.

### Things to do

Some compilations: [twowanderingsoles.com](https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/unique-experiences-in-chiang-mai-thailand#Adventurous-Things-to-do-in-Chiang-Mai).
