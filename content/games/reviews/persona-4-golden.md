title: "Persona 4: Golden"

Just finished the game and I'm honestly feeling a little speechless. What a
fantastic game. I didn't expect it, but Persona 4: Golden has fast become one
of my favorite RPGs. I'm a sucker for stories featuring camaraderie between a
cast of characters, and this game delivers that so, so well. The interactions
between each character felt so genuine, I found myself sitting there with a
smile on my face for much of my playthrough.

You know that feeling when you finish a book or TV series you really loved? I
call it a book hangover, it's such a bittersweet feeling, having to say goodbye
to the world and its characters. I felt the same with the world Persona 4 and
its characters. This game is the perfect remedy for loneliness.

I have a couple recommendations for anyone interested in the game:

1. Try the game out with Japanese audio and English subs, you might prefer it.
   I much preferred this setup; couldn't stand the English dubs.
2. Go in as blind as you can. Stay away from forums until you've finished the
   game.
