## Maps

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - Select the CyclOSM or OpenCycleMap overlays.
- [Google Maps: Map of park connectors](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&dg=feature&mid=1wpVo946QUwM2HM4MvNmvr2UdYG0&ll=1.4152748545020726%2C103.8337928146973&z=13)
- [Google Maps: Better map of park connectors](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1d-f3wTmqM3jmT7C1LtTzorsRbGw&shorturl=1&ll=1.333225619549455%2C103.93625551620613&z=15) - PCNs, CPNs, MTB routes, common road links, annotations.

## Route planning

- [BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/) - OSM-based. Very customizable. Intuitive route planning. My current go-to for route planning.
- [OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/) - Just an overlay over OSM; no routing capabilities. UI is fast. Information is clearly displayed. Mostly useful just for high level exploration.
- [OpenRouteService](https://maps.openrouteservice.org) - OSM-based. Uses the CyclOSM overlay. Less customizable compared to BRouter. Route suggestions are not as complete, because you can't customize your preference cycling paths. A few annoying UI quirks.
- [RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/new) - OSM-based. One of the better route planners. Requires an account to save and export, probable dealbreaker.

## Bike build

Various notes collected on the quest to build myself a bike.

### Rims

More spokes lead to a better distribution of load, thus resulting in a stronger wheel. More spokes leads to a heavier wheel. 24 or 28 spokes is generally common for road bikes.

As for materials, aluminum is fine for myself. Will only be riding for leisure, so don't need to optimize for performance. Currently one of the aesthetics I'd like is a black bike with a silver accent - silver rims would be nice.

Be sure to choose the right tire width for your rim's width. Generally any tire width will work with any rim width, though manufacturers will often provide recommendations on their site. [Sheldon Brown has a chart for recommended width combinations](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width).

If using rim brakes, make sure that the rim lines up with the brake shoes. Some rims don't have a surface for rim brakes to grip onto, these rims are typically denoted as disc-only.
