Here are some quickfire reviews of various [Outlier](https://outlier.nyc/)
clothing I own.

## Tops

### Ultrafine Merino T-shirt (Cut One)

- 100% 17.5 micron merino. 195gsm. Knit.
- The warmest of my Outlier t-shirts, but not any warmer than a generic cotton
  tee.
- Feels substantial due to the 195gsm fabric weight. Often you'll find merino
  clothing at 160-180gsm instead.
- The black is a really deep black.
- Haven't worn it too much to form much of an opinion yet.

### Ramielust T-shirt (Cut One)

- 100% Ramie. 200gsm. Knit.
- Extremely breathable. Incredible in hot humid weather.
- This is my favorite shirt to wear in Singapore, due to how well it performs
  in our weather.
- Dries super fast.
- Has a noticeable texture to it. There's also a slight sheen to the material.
  As a result this shirt has a very casual vibe. It would not dress up as well as a UFT.

### Dreamweight Raw Cut Shortsleeve

- 75% 16.5 micron merino, 25% nylon. 110gsm. Knit.
- Very lightweight, as you can tell from the 110gsm weight.
- Fits a bit tight around the chest.
- I love the raw cut aesthetic, but it's not for everyone.
- Raw cut hems tend to roll a little, mostly along the bottom hem.
- The neck hem has some fraying (by design). I love this detail.
- There is a wavy texture to the material. The waves catch the light
  differently, which makes the texture even more obvious. I hypothesize the
  wavy texture is due to the way nylon is knit into the fabric. I absolutely
  love this texture, it has so much character.
- This shirt gives off an ultra casual vibe.
- May not be the most durable of my Outlier clothing. Has some pilling around
  the back where my backpack rubs against the fabric. So far this is only
  cosmetic, my pair hasn't developed any holes or thin spots yet.
- Excellent for travel in tropical countries due to it being a very lightweight
  merino blend.
- This is my favorite T-shirt material from Outlier, as far as looks go.

## Bottoms

### Futureworks

- Inhouse F. Cloth fabric. 97% nylon, 3% elastane canvas. 200gsm. 35% two-way
  stretch.
- Performs relatively well in Singapore's weather. Much better than jeans.
  Fairly breathable, so doesn't run too hot.
- Very smart looking chino. Can be easily dressed up.
- Drapes relatively well. However I would only recommend short stacks. The fabric is
  quite lightweight, so long stacks won't look as good.
- Good mobility with the two-way stretch.
- Fits slim. Leans a little towards the casual side.
- Very versatile piece. I have two pairs, one in black (more like charcoal in
  reality), and one in olive.

### OG Climbers

- OG Cloth. 80% nylon, 10% polyester, 10% elastane. 240gsm. Four-way stretch.
- Discontinued now. I bought this secondhand from
  [Grailed](https://www.grailed.com/).
- Incredible mobility due to the four-way stretch.
- This is the stretchiest fabric I've felt, even more so than the Mission Jean
  from Mission Workshop.
- Very, very comfortable due to the stretchiness.
- Fabric does not breathe very well. Not great in Singapore's weather.
- This would easily be my first choice of travel pants to a temperate country.
- Fits a little loose. Especially in the tights and butt. I'm not a huge fan of
  the fit.

### Injected Linen Pants

- 59% linen, 41% polyester. 165gsm. Knit.
- Very unique fabric. It's made inhouse by Outlier. I haven't seen any other
  linen piece with similar fabric. Due to the polyester, it doesn't crease as
  much as 100% linen.
- Has a slubby texture due to the linen. I really like texture on my clothing,
  and I really like slub in particular. I used to wear a pair of Japan Blue
  JB0212 for years, which is a heavyweight and super slubby jean.
- Loose fit. Linen has no stretch so this is necessary for mobility.
- Mobility is surprisingly good despite the lack of stretch. In fact I get more
  mobility in these ILPs than I do in the Futureworks. I have no issue cycling
  in these pants.
- Breathes extremely well. This pants works amazingly in a tropical climate
  like Singapore.
- This is my go-to travel pants for tropical countries. It's lightweight,
  breathable, comfortable, and dries super quick.
