The content in this page is second-hand. I haven't shipped with Qxpress before,
but I've heard good testimonials from people who have.

The great thing about Qxpress is that they pick it up from your location. In
fact, the service is used not just by sellers, but buyers as well. Buyers can
arrange for Qxpress to pick up the item from the seller's location.

Here are the steps to use Qxpress (provided by a colleague):

1. Find Qxpress on the app or web
2. You'll be able to select "Next day delivery" or "3h delivery" which are
   local OR international delivery.
3. Put in the estimated weight, ensuring that the size restrictions are met.
   The site will then estimate amount for you to pay.
4. Insert the details like what you're shipping, how much it's worth, address,
   contact number. You also have to select when you want the item to be picked
   up (it's between 10am to 7pm on the next day at the earliest).
5. Submit the form and make payment.
6. Qoo10 will SMS you the next day (or the day you've selected) to remind you
   that they'll be picking the thing up.
