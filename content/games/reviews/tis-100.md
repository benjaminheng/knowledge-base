This is a programming puzzle game. However, you don't need to know programming
to understand the game. It certainly helps, but this game is less about writing
code and more about the logic processes involved in building a solution. If you
have a logical mind and enjoy puzzles, this game may be for you. If you enjoy
programming, this game is most definitely for you.

The game uses a fictional implementation of an assembly type language. You get
a manual in PDF form. Yes, you have to read a manual. It's not complicated
though, as there are only a handful of operations available to you. There's
enough to allow for interesting solutions yet limited enough to make the game
challenging. A very good balance between the two, I'd say.

Regarding the puzzle aspect, you're expected to work with nodes, each only
allowing a limited number of lines and containing two memory registers (no
addressable memory!), only one of which can be actively accessed for read/write
operations. As a result, you need to structure your program around these
limitations, perhaps by breaking it down into various components.

The problems are varied and quite grounded in real-world applications (sequence
peak detector, histogram, etc.). The game is simplistic and doesn't hold your
hand, but the problems are organized such that there's a clear difficulty curve
as you progress. The curve should be quite manageable for those with prior
experience in programming.

There are also leaderboards so you can compare how efficient your solution was
compared to your friends, because who doesn't like improving?

Wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who loves programming.
