## Hot sauce

### 1 -- Jalapeno, ghost pepper

- 6 jalapeno peppers (150g)
- 0.5 ghost pepper
- 10 garlic cloves (30g)
- 1/2 yellow onion (70g)
- 3.5% brine

Log:
- 24h: Only a few bubbles. Minimal sign of fermentation. Consider lowering the brine percentage for the next batch.
- 48h: More bubbles! Solution starting to get cloudy. No mold yet. Looking good so far.
- Day 5: Fementation going well. No mold. I"m not using any weights so the peppers are floating to the top.
- Day 15: Still going well. No mold. Using a fermentation weight for the past few days.
- Day 21: Bottled.

Bottling notes:
- Added 50g of pineapple, some lemon zest, white vinegar, black pepper, and salt.
- Taste lacks depth. Quite spicy, but not much of other flavors. Consistency is a bit thick.
- pH brought down to 3.6 using white vinegar.
- Takeaways:
    - Blend with more of the fermentation liquid.
    - Pineapple alone isn't enough.
    - Consider fermenting with bell peppers.
    - Other spices are needed.

### 2 -- Habanero

- 100g habanero peppers (10pc)
- 38g garlic
- 70g onion
- 3.5% brine based on total weight

Log:
- 24h: Bubbles appearing. Starting to get cloudy. Fermentation started earlier than the previous batch.

### 3 -- Habanero

Not started yet. Some notes:

- Habaneros, onions, garlic
- Carrots
- Roasted peppers, for the smoky flavor
- Lime for acid
- 2 weeks ferment. Ferments in our relatively high temperature goes faster. 3 weeks might be a bit too much.
- Apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar?
