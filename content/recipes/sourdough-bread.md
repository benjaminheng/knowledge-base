## Overview

- Day 1: Refresh starter
- Day 2: Prepare dough
- Day 3: Bake!

## Day 1: Refresh starter

The ratios here make enough for one loaf of bread. Use 20g starter, 100g flour, and 100g water for two loaves. First feeding is best around 11am, second feeding around the same time, and the starter will be ready the next morning.

1. Discard all but 15g starter.
2. Add 75g white bread flour.
3. Mix.
4. Add 75g water.
5. Mix.
6. Wait 10-12 hours.
7. Repeat.

## Day 2: Prepare dough

The ratios here are for one loaf.

Autolyse:

1. Add 350g white bread flour.
2. Add 150g wheat flour.
3. Mix.
4. Add 375g water.
5. Mix. Use a bench scraper because it gets sticky.
6. Wait 60min. Cover with damp towel.

Incorporate starter:

1. Add 100g starter
2. Mix by pinching
3. Add 10g salt
4. Add 10 water
5. Mix by pinching
6. Wait 10min. Cover with damp towel.

Building gluten:

1. Mix by folding for about 10min.
2. Check using windowpane test. Keep going for at most another 10min if it fails the test.
3. Wait 60min. Cover with damp towel.

Bulk fermentation:

1. Fold 4 times, turning the bowl 90deg after each fold.
2. Wait 60min.
3. Repeat for 4-7 times. 6 works well for me.
