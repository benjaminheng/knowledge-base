## Hot sauce

### 1 -- Jalapeno, ghost pepper

- 6 jalapeno peppers (150g)
- 0.5 ghost pepper
- 10 garlic cloves (30g)
- 1/2 yellow onion (70g)
- 3.5% brine

Additional notes:

- Buy pH testers
- Bring pH down to < 4.5 using vinegar or lime juice to stabilize it before storing. Botulism threshold is 4.6? Aim for 3.5?
- Add fruits at the end

Log:
- 24h: Only a few bubbles. Minimal sign of fermentation. Consider lowering the brine percentage for the next batch.
