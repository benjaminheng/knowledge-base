title: "Tailors"
---

I've had good experiences with [YinYin Fashion Alteration
Specialist](https://goo.gl/maps/5Di7ugBGnoP2xpgNA) in the past. They're located
at Tanjong Pagar. I had three pairs of pants altered there. Turnaround time is
quick and the quality of the alteration is good. Now that I no longer work at
Tanjong Pagar, it's a bit inconvenient to go down to tailor clothes. I'm
currently looking for a new tailor nearer to my place.
