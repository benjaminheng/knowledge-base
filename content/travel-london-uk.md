## Accomodation

[Star Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/star-hotel.en-gb.html) is a good
option for cheap-ish accommodation. It's near the Hammersmith tube station, and
is very well connected to the rest of the city. The Picadilly, Central, and
District lines are available; between them you can easily reach most of the
city. There is no hotel safe available. Rooms are small. Located in west
London, in the Hammersmith area, with relatively low crime.

## Getting around

Contactless cards or mobile payments like Google/Apply Pay will work. An Oyster
card isn't necessary. If deciding to get an Oyster card, they can be purchased
from tube stations or at newsagents.

When taking the tube, tap in and tap out. When taking the bus, only tap in.

Use the CityMapper app to plan trips.

## Safety

General tips:

- Snatch thieves are common. Don't walk around using your phone. Be aware of
  your surroundings if you need to use your phone.
- Pickpockets are common in tourist areas. Such places include Westminster,
  Oxford Street, Covent Gardens, Leicester Square, etc. Be particularly
  protective of your belongings in these areas.
- Pickpockets also exist in other parts of London, so don't get complacent.
- Look up crime statistics in your area before booking accommodation. You can
  use the [official site](https://www.met.police.uk/a/your-area/) or other
  sites.
- The east side of London generally has higher crime.
- At night, keep to lit areas when walking. Especially if walking alone.
- Women should be extra careful walking alone at night.

Tips for East Asians and other minority races:

- If you are East Asian, you will be at higher risk due to anti-Asian sentiment
  in the wake of COVID-19. You will be more of a target of pickpockets and
  thieves.
- Violent hate crimes against Asians are on the rise. This is not limited to London.

- Non-violent crimes against Asians may be more common compared to other races,
  due to perceptions to submissiveness.

- On tube stations, don't stand near the tracks. [People have been killed by
  being intentionally pushed onto the tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Michelle_Go). Stand behind a
  pillar, or with your back to the wall.
